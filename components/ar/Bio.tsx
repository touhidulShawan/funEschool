        is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the
        objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated
        perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities,
        including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.

        AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a
        combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and
        accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. AR can help
        student to visualize the objects.
